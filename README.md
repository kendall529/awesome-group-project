# Emotionally Supported Trivia


## Description 
We decided to create a website that allows the user to participate in a 10-question trivia quiz. The user is also able to choose what type of category they would like the quiz to be centered around. The active user will see their score fluctuate based on how many questions they get right and wrong. Whenever the user gets a question wrong, the user will see an image of a dog populate on the screen. This dog image acts as an emotional support dog to help ease the user and have a calmer presence for the next question. 
Once the user completes the quiz, they will be prompted to enter their name into a text box. Which allows the user to see a scoreboard of the previous scores.
